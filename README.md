## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd PolyQuestApp
   ```

2. **Install Node Modules:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Application:**
   ```bash
   npm dev
   ```

   The frontend should now be running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd PolyQuestAPI
   ```

2. **Configure the Database:**
   - **Please Note**: Our database is being hosted on AWS and will be taken down the end of the following week. This means that the database connection will no longer work. If you wish to test the application and run through it, please update the database connection string to your MySQL or SQLite version.

3. **Install Dependencies and Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4a. **Alternative:** If you load the Java project on IntellJ, please update your packages and it should run normally

   The backend should now be running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Documentation

### API Docs
PolyQuest's backend utilizes Swagger.io, with in-built API documentation accessible at `(http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#)`.



Detailed information for each endpoint is available in the API Docs.

## App Design

### Overview
The PolyQuest system is structured to deliver a user-centric experience, leveraging both backend and frontend to support students' educational planning.

### Frontend 
The frontend is built with React and is organized by user role (Student, Teacher, Admin) to streamline user navigation. Components, routes, and utilities are housed in `/src/` folders:
- **/routes**: Contains role-specific routes.
- **/components**: Reusable components.
- **/utils**: Helper functions to enhance frontend code readability.

The entry point is `/src/routes/_root.tsx`.

### Backend
The backend structure, built with Java SpringBoot, is designed for modularity and scalability:

- **Controller**: Manages incoming HTTP requests, forwarding them to appropriate service methods and returning the responses to clients.
- **Service**: Contains the core business logic, interacting with repositories to process data and execute application-specific functions.
- **Repository**: Acts as a data access layer, handling database operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for entities, abstracted via JPA (Java Persistence API).
- **Model**: Defines the structure and attributes of database entities, representing tables and their relationships in Java objects.
- **DTO**: Defines the data transfer objects used for some APIs.
